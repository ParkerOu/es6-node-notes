# Things must know before go ahead
## JS syntax is like C
```js
if (score >= 60){
    console.log('passed!');
} else {
    console.log('failed!');
}
```
## JS is **Dynamic typing**
Type checking is running at **runtime**
## JS is **Weak typing**
**Type can change** on runtime  
```js
seven = '7';
eleven = 11;
console.log(seven + eleven);
// output '711'
```
variable eleven type auto convert from int to string
## JS is **Asynchronous**
You canâ€™t just call one function after another and hope they execute in the right order.
```js
function first(){
  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout( function(){
    console.log(1);
  }, 500 );
}
function second(){
  console.log(2);
}
first();
second();
// output: 2
// output: 1
```
## [Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)
> The variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase, but stay exactly where you typed them in your code.
```js
function catName(name) {
  console.log("My cat's name is " + name);
}

catName("Tigger");
// output: "My cat's name is Tigger"
```
Putting function declarations into memory before it executes any code segment is that it allows you to **use a function before you declare it** in your code.
